df607a3f,Ryan Miller,Suspect Page Finished,Finished the Suspects page for the UI.
When talking to an NPC for the first time a new entry is added in the suspect pool
the new entry is a button. Clicking it opens the suspect data page, which shows the character mugshot and any notes that the player has on the character.

Player can now travel between 3 locations

- Drive in (Bearly Pictures)
- Finger Monster Alley (Shelf Street)

Removed the purple cubes for travelling within a location. Larger colliders to allow players to require less accuracy when moving between zones
Projector room redone for the minute. Added in the actual projector model and added in a sticker version of Grizzly's stuffing onto the back.

Added controls for camera's on a track and dolly. Currently moving cameras tracking offset to allow the player to look up and down when on a Left/Right Track. Will do the opposite for Forward/Back Tracks.
